	Progris riport 2 - martch 4.<br>
I had a test today. I think I faled it and I think mabye now they wont use<br>
me. What happind is I went to Prof Nemurs office on my lunch time like they<br>
said and his secertery took me to a place that said psych dept on the door<br>
with a long hall and alot of littel rooms with onley a desk and chares. And<br>
a nice man was in one of the rooms and he had some wite cards with ink spilld<br>
all over them. He sed sit down Charlie and make yourself cunfortible and<br>
rilax. He had a wite coat like a docter but I dont think. he was no docter<br>
because he dint tell me to opin my mouth and say ah. All he had was those<br>
wite cards. His name is Burt. I fergot his last name because I dont remembir<br>
so good.<br>
<br>
I dint know what he was gonna do and I was holding on tite to the chair like<br>
sometimes when I go to a dentist onley Burt aint no dentist neither but he<br>
kept telling me to rilax and that gets me skared because it always means its<br>
gonna hert.<br>
<br>
So Burt sed Charlie what do you see on this card. I saw the spilld ink and<br>
I was very skared even tho I got my rabits foot in my pockit because when I<br>
was a kid I always faled tests in school and I spilld ink to.<br>
<br>
I tolld Burt I saw ink spilld on a wite card. Burt said yes and he smild and<br>
that maid me feel good. He kept terning all the cards and I tolld him<br>
somebody spilld ink on all of them red and black. I thot that was a easy test<br>
but when I got up to go Burt stoppd me and said now sit down Charlie we are<br>
not thru yet.Theres more we got to do with these cards. I dint understand<br>
about it but I remembir Dr Strauss said do anything the testor telld me even<br>
if it dont make no sense because thats testing.<br>
<br>
I dont remembir so good what Burt said but I remembir he wantid me to say<br>
what was in the ink. I dint see nothing in the ink but Burt sed there was<br>
picturs there. I coudnt see no picturs. I reely tryed to see.  holded the<br>
card up close and then far away. Then I said if I had my eye glassis I coud<br>
probaly see better I usully only ware my eyeglassis in the movies or to watch<br>
TV but I sed maybe they will help me see the picturs in the ink. I put them<br>
on and I said now let me see the card agars I bet I find it now.<br>
I tryed hard but I still coudnt find the picturs I only saw the ink. <br>
tolld<br>
Burt mabey I need new glassis. He rote somthing down on a paper and I got<br>
skared of faling the test. So I tolld him it was a very nice pictur of ink<br>
with pritty points all around the <a href="final.html" id="wordLink" style="text-decoration:none;color:black">eges</a> but he shaked his head so that wasnt<br>
it neither. I asked him if other pepul saw things in the ink and he sed yes<br>
they imagen picturs in the inkblot. <br>He tolld me the ink on the card was calld<br>
inkblot.<br>
Burt is very nice and he tasks slow like Miss Kinman dose in her class where<br>
I go to lern reeding for slow adults. He explaned me it was a raw shok test. He<br>
sed pepul see things in the ink.<br>
I said show me where. He dint show me he<br>
just kept saying think imagen theres something on the card. I tolld him I imaggen<br>
a inkblot.<br>
He shaked his head so that wasnt rite eather. He said what does it remind you<br>
of pretend its something. I closd my eyes for a long time to pretend and then I<br>
said I pretend a bottel of ink spilld all over a wite card. And thats when<br>
the point on his pencel broke and then we got up and went out.<br>
I dont think I passd the raw shok test.<br>
3d progris riport.<br>
Martch 5 - Dr Strauss and prof Nemur say it dont matter about the ink on the<br>
cards. I tolld them I dint spill the ink on them and I coudnt see anything in<br>
the ink. They said maybe they will still use me. I tolld Dr Strauss that Miss<br>
Kinnian never gave me tests like that only riting and reeding. He said Miss<br>
Kinnian tolld him I was her bestist pupil in the Beekman School for retarted<br>
adults and I tryed the hardist becaus I reely wantd to lern I wantid it more<br>
even then pepul who are smarter even then me.<br>
Dr Strauss askd me how come you went to the Beekman School all by yourself<br>
Charlie. How did you find out about it. I said I dont remembir.<br>
Prof Nemur said but why did you want to lern to reed and spell in the frist<br>
place. I tolld him because all my life I wantid to be smart and not dumb and<br>
my mom always tolld me to try and lern just like Miss Kinnian tells me but<br>
its very hard to be smart and even when I lern something in Miss Kinnians<br>
class at the school I ferget alot.<br>
<br>Dr Strauss rote some things on a peice of paper and prof Nemur talkd to me<br>
very sereus. He said you know Charlie we are not shure how this experamint<br>
will werk on pepul because we onley tried it up to now on animils. I said<br>
thats what Miss Kinnian tolld me but I dont even care if it herts or anything<br>
because Im strong and I will werk hard.<br>
<br>I want to get smart if they will let me. They said they got to get permissen<br>
from my familie but my uncle Herman who use to take care of me is ded and I<br>
dont remember about my familie. I dint see my mother or father or my littel<br>
sister Norma for a long long long time. Mabye their ded to. Dr Strauss askd me<br>
where they use to live. I think in brooklin. He sed they will see if mabye they<br>
can find them.<br>
<br>I hope I dont have to rite to much of these progris ri-ports because it takes<br>
along time and I get to sleep very late and Im tired at werk in the morning. Gimpy<br>
hollered at me because I droppd a tray full of rolles I was carrying<br>
over to the oven. They got derty and he had to wipe them off before he put<br>
them in to bake. Gimpy hollers at me all the time when I do something rong,<br>
but he reely likes me because hes my frend. Boy if I get smart wont he be<br>
serprised.<br>
